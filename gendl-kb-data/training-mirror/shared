There is also a commercial version offering proprietary/closed-source distribution rights, full levels of technical support and with some extra features like surface and solid modelling. The commercial version is packaged with Allegro CL from Franz Inc.</p><h3>About These tutorials</h3><p>The tutorials are designed to be self-paced learning resources and where appropriate  contain example code files which may be downloaded. It is recommended that the first  two tutorials, <a href="/installing-gendl/index.html">Installing GendL</a> and <a href="/getting-started/index.html">Getting Started with GendL</a> are completed in that  order - after that we move into more specific or advanced subjects which may be undertaken as required. Within each tutorial there are a number of topics,  which we would suggest are undertaken in the order presented.</p><h3>Tutorials</h3><div class="ml-3"><ol class="list-decimal"><li><a href="/installing-gendl/index.html">Installing GendL</a><br /></li><li><a href="/getting-started/index.html">Getting started with GendL</a><br /></li><li><a href="/code-structuring/index.html">Structuring and Organising your code</a><br /></li><li><a href="/file-io/index.html">Reading from and Writing to Files</a><br /></li><li><a href="/more-objects/index.html">More on Objects</a><br /></li><li><a href="/websites/index.html">Websites and Web Applications</a><br /></li></ol></div></div></div></div></body></html>
