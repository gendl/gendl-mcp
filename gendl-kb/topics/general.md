GENDL PROJECT STRUCTURE BEST PRACTICES
=====================================

0. PROJECT GENERATION:
   - Use the gendl-skel utility: (gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name "my-project")
   - This creates a complete project structure with all necessary files

1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   - /project-name/           Root directory
   - /project-name/source/    Source files
   - /project-name/*.asd      ASDF system definition

2. PACKAGE DEFINITION:
   - Use (gdl:define-package :your-package-name) without :use clauses
   - GDL, GDL-USER, etc. are automatically included

3. SYSTEM LOADING:
   - Use cl-lite for automatic dependency management
   - Example:
     (load-quicklisp)
     (cl-lite "/path/to/project/" :create-asd-file? t)
```

```
tomatic dependency management
   - Example:
     (load-quicklisp)
     (cl-lite "/path/to/project/" :create-asd-file? t)
     (pushnew "/path/to/project/" ql:*local-project-directories* :test #'equalp)
     (ql:quickload :your-project)

4. OBJECT REFERENCES:
   - Use "theo" instead of "the-object" for cleaner syntax
   - Example: (theo my-object slot-name)
   - For nested: (theo container child-object slot-name)

5. BEST PRACTICES:
   - Use file-ordering.isc for controlling file load order
   - Break complex objects into modular components
   - Let cl-lite manage ASDF file generation

Structuring and Organising your code Tutorial: Structuring and Organising your code <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Now that you have completed the Getting Started with GendL tutorial, its worth giving some thought to the way you may want to organise and load the code you will be writing. This tutorial covers some basic principles and provides a few guidelines that we would consider to be best practice. The best time to get organised is right at the start as it will avoid getting locked in to less then optimal working practices, or needing to go through all your code at a later date to retro-fit it to your chosen organisation structure or methodology Working with Packages Package Tips Code Structuring Loading Code with cl-lite Index

( Whilst you can open the file containing an object or function code from in emacs by positioning the cursor in the object/function name and using Meta-. , the one object/function per file goal does make life easier) Directory organisation Where possible and practical arrange the directory structure so that it mirrors the applications object structure Strike a balance between granularity - some logical separation is good, but avoid separating too much For each module create a source directory for the source code files In larger projects define a common folder for code that is shared between the other modules In the example on the right, the airplane/source directory would be used for

tory for the source code files In larger projects define a common folder for code that is shared between the other modules In the example on the right, the airplane/source directory would be used for the source code assembling the different modules into an airplane. The common directory would be used for shared objects/functions and the main application code would be stored in the source directories of each module - engine, wing, fuselage. Some considertion ought to be given at this stage to the package design; a single :airplane package may be adequate or the packages could be broken down by module, each of the sub-modules using airplane-common and the top level airplane package using all of the sub-module packages.A bit of time spent at the outset of a project is usuually time well spent, although the result doesn't need to be perfect since it is easy enough to change as the project/application evolves The suggested codebase structure is also compatible with cl-lite, GendL's code

Loading Code with cl-lite Loading Code with cl-lite <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> In previous topics, we have seen that there is some requirement to manage the load order. With small numbers of source files this is manageable manually, but once the number of source files exceeds maybe 5 or 6, this becomes an onerous and somewhat tedious task GendL has a utility to support this called cl-lite . It can be called from either the REPL or it can be initiated from the init file (gdlinit.cl). cl-lite supports the following features It will load any .lisp file found in any source directory below the target directory.
```

## index.html (chunk 2/4)

```
So in the example codebase on the right, if cl-lite was applied to the airplane directory it would load .lisp files from source , common/source , engine/source , fuselage/source and wing/source The order in which directories are loaded may be specified at any level using a system-ordering.isc file The order in which files in a source folder are loaded may be specified for that source directory in a file-ordering.isc file Directories or files to be ignored can be specified in an ignore-list.isc file The structure of the system-ordering.isc , file-ordering.isc and ignore-list.isc is identical; it is a literal list of strings identifying target folders or files. Note that ignore-list.isc may apply to either directories or files whilst system-ordering.isc only applies to directories and file-ordering.isc only applies to files Executing cl-lite cl-lite takes a pathname argument.
```

ordering.isc only applies to files Executing cl-lite cl-lite takes a pathname argument. The pathname may be a string or a logical pathname (cl-lite "/codebase/airplane") If we wanted to enforce a load order for the directories we would use the system-ordering.isc file . In this example, assuming multiple packages which mirror the directory structure, we would probably want to load common first, then engine , wing and fuselage (since they would :use the :airplane-common package) and lastly the source directory since it would :use all of the previously defined packages.
```

---

## index.html (chunk 4/4)
Source: training-mirror/code-structuring/loading-code/index.html
Type: unknown

```
So system-ordering.isc would look like this ("common" "wing" "fuselage" "engine" "source") Assuming each of the folders has a package file, we would want to load that as the first file when the directory is loaded, so each source folder would have a file-ordering.isc file like this ("package") 2 things to note here There is no need to specify the file extension There is only a requirement to specify files which have special load order, any other files in the folder are loaded by default in alphabetical order Finally, if for some reason we wished to suppress the load of the engine module, we would use the ignore-list.isc file in the airplane directory as shown below ("engine")

uses those packages. We'll get onto both of these topics later Packages must be defined before other packages can refer to them Practically this means avoiding circularities in the :use statement, but again implies form form of load order which again means keeping code defining packages in separate files Code files should contain one, and only one , in-package statement and this should be the first line of code in that file As far as Common Lisp is concerned you can put multiple in-package statements in a file. There are however 2 reasons why this approach would be considered good practice It avoids confusing humand who might not notice a second or third in-package statement The emacs/SLIME development environment look for the in-package statement to determine the package to be used when communicationg with Common Lisp and multiple in-package statement may confuse these tools A final consideration is naming of Packages and particularly avoiding package name clashes.

ommunicationg with Common Lisp and multiple in-package statement may confuse these tools A final consideration is naming of Packages and particularly avoiding package name clashes. This isn't generally a problem when you are only using packages that you have developed, but if you are sharing them with other programmers, or using third party packages this needs to be considered, with some kind of naming convention. As a package name is just a text string you can adopt any convention you choose. A trend seems to be a reverse internet domain name followed by a description, for example com.genworks.my-app Some package gotcha's Generally once you've got working with packages you won't need to think about them that much, they just do what they're supposed to do. But occasionally, and mainly when setting up new packages, there can be a few 'odd' errors. Perhaps the most common is symbol conflicts.

setting up new packages, there can be a few 'odd' errors. Perhaps the most common is symbol conflicts. Consider the following case You create a package, say my-package , which you expect to use a function, say test-function , which is :exported from another package my-functions In the source code for the app using my-package , you refer to test-function by its symbol only - which is fine because its exported But you've forgotten to :use my-functions when defining the package my-package So when you try to run the compiled code, you'll get an 'undefined function' error. No problem, you return to the define-package statement for my-package , add (:use my-functions) and then try to run again. This time you get a conflicting symbols error! Whats happened here is that the first time you run the code the the symbol test-function is interned in my-package .

code the the symbol test-function is interned in my-package . Then you :use my-functions from which test-function is exported so you've got a conflicting symbol clash! The solution is to accept the restart to unintern test-function from my-package and then recompile the my-package package Another issue potential issue is You create a package, say my-package , which :uses my-functions my-functions :exports a number of functions You then define a function in my-package which has the same symbol as a function :exported from my-functions What will happen here is that your function in my-package will effectively overwrite the function of the same name in my-functions . In most Lisps you'll get a warning that a symbol is being redefined, but its not classed as an error A final package-related issue is to do with dropping out of Geysr into the REPL to do some debugging.

ssue is to do with dropping out of Geysr into the REPL to do some debugging. If the debugging is referring to slots defined in a package other than the REPL's current package, when you try to evaluate the slot you'll get an 'undefined function' error. The simple solution to this is to change the REPL's package, using the in-package function, to the package of the code that you're working with and evaluate the expression again

Working with Packages Working with Packages | ^UP^ | Next-> Packages represent namespaces for Lisp symbols. You can think of them like an "area-code" for symbols. In the tutorial, all of the example code that was provided started with the (in-package :gdl-user) statement. All of the symbols created when objects were defined, belonged to the :gdl-user package. Because all source code files stared with the (in-package :gdl-user) statement we don't need to qualify any of the symbols, we just use their name. But if we wanted to use a symbol from another package that wasn't used by :gdl-user we would need to qualify that symbol with a package name. To create a package, we Call the Gendl macro define-package Define the name of the new package Optionally provide a list of packages it will :use .
```

## index.html (chunk 2/7)

```
Note that define-package automatically includes the following packages: :common-lisp :gdl :geom-base :surf Optionally define a list of symbols that the package will :export In most cases we create a lisp file, normally called package.lisp (this is just a convention, not a requirement) to do this. We need to set a working pakage and for this the :gdl-user package is suitable. The we call the GendL define-package macro. So if we define some package code like this (in-package :gdl-user) (define-package :my-app) Then in the REPL we can use the in-package function to switch to out new package GDL-USER> (in-package :my-app) #<Package "MY-APP"> The :export option When we define a new package we can :export symbols from that package for external use. Whilst symbols from that package can still be accessed even if the aren't exported , it isn't considered to be good practice to do this, it's up to the package owner to choose to export or expose which symbols are for external use.

accessed even if the aren't exported , it isn't considered to be good practice to do this, it's up to the package owner to choose to export or expose which symbols are for external use. A good watchword is "Not Exported = Unsupported" Extending our define-package example to :export a symbol my-slot from our package would look like this (in-package :gdl-user) (define-package :my-app (:export #:my-slot)) In some cases it is convenient to :export a symbol after define-package has been evaluated. This may be the case, for example, where we have a number of functions to be :exported and it is easier to manage the :export from within the functions source code file.
```

## index.html (chunk 4/7)

```
To do this we can use the Common Lisp Special Operator eval-when as shown in the example below (in-package :functions) (eval-when (load eval) (export 'average)) (defun average (lis) (/ (apply '+ lis) (length lis))) In this example the function average is exported from the :functions package when either a top-level form in a compiled file is being loaded ( load ) or when the expression would be evaluated anyway ( eval ) The :use option To access a symbol which has been exported from a package we need to use the fully qualified name for that symbol - in other words its package and symbol seperated by a colon. However, if we :use a package when we create a new package, we can access exported symbols using their symbol only. Creating a new package which uses the package created earlier would look like this (in-package :gdl-user) (define-package :my-other-app (:use :my-app)) Bringing it all together Let's consider 3 packages, package-a , package-b and package-c .

Reading from a file Reading from a file <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Compared with writing to a file, reading from a file is a much more involved process. As with writing a file, a stream is opened and connected to the file. But then the file contents need to be read, line by line, until the end of the file. In general we will not know how many lines are to be read. Once the data has been read, it needs to be converted or conditioned into a format that the application can use. This implies We know something about the format of the data being supplied The data is supplied in that known format It is often the achilles heel of many applications which take data from the outside world and effort in making this interface as robust as possible is always time well spent A general purpose function to read data from a text file may look something like this (defun read-file (file)) (let ((result)) (with-open-file (str file :direction :input) (do ((line (read-line str nil 'eof) (read-line str nil

read data from a text file may look something like this (defun read-file (file)) (let ((result)) (with-open-file (str file :direction :input) (do ((line (read-line str nil 'eof) (read-line str nil 'eof))) ((eql line 'eof) result) (setq result (append result (list line))))))) We have introduced the use of the CL macro do as part of the body of expressions wrapped in with-open-file do accepts a list of variable expressions in the form (variable initial-iteration subsequent-iterations ). The initial-iteration is an expression which is evaluated on the first iteration and subsequent-iterations is an expression evaluated on all subsequent iterations. In our case we are using the CL function read-line The first argument is the stream which comes from with-open-file , the second argument determines if an end of file error should be signalled, in this case nil, and the third argument is the value returned when end of file is encountered.

nes if an end of file error should be signalled, in this case nil, and the third argument is the value returned when end of file is encountered. The output of read-line is set to the variable line which is appended into the result variable. The second list in do defines the condition to be met to end iteration (in this case, the value of line is the end of file value) and the value to be returned when this condition is T, in this case result Evaluating this function against the file created in the previous topic gives the following GDL-USER> (read-file "c:/temp/report.txt") ("Box Width 3" "Box Length 6" "Box Height 4" "Box Center 0.0,0.0,0.0" "Box Volume 72") The next task when reading a data file is generally parsing it to convert it into a format that our application can use.

ta into a variable raw-data . This is a list of strings, where each string is a separate line from the file The we use the function glisp:split-regexp to split each string into separate words, breaking where there is one or more whitespaces (the regular-expression "\\s+") Because we know the structure of the data, we can comfortably discarded the first word from each line and convert the second word into a keyword. By using mapcan the local variable res-1 becomes a plist of keyword and value, although each value is still a string We need to convert the values into the correct data types, but it's different depending on what value we are considering. length , width and height will all be numbers, whilst center will be a point (vector). Finally, we use the keywords to determine how to process the data and return a plist.

File IO Basics File IO Basics | ^UP^ | Next-> The basics of file I/O To read and write from or to a file, we do this via a stream which is connected to the file. The most basic mechanism for connecting a stream to a file is by using the CL function open , which takes the following arguments filename - required keyword argument :direction which can be either :input or :output or :io (both directions) keyword argument :if-exists - what to do if the file exists - the most common values being :overwrite , :append or :supersede .
```

```
The difference between :overwrite and :supersede is the former causes the existing file to be modified at the beginning of the output, whilst the latter delays the deletion of the original file until the stream is closed keyword argument :if-does-not-exist - the most common value is :create where the :direction is :output or :io and :if-exists is neither :overwrite nor :append There are other keyword arguments and valid values, the above are just the most commonly used. GDL-USER> (defparameter *my-stream* (open "c:/temp/missing-file.txt" :direction :output :if-does-not-exist :create *MY-STREAM* Once the file is open we can then write to that stream, for example using the format function we covered in the Getting Started with GendL tutorial.

GDL-USER> (close *MY-STREAM*) T Writing to a file for the first time Avoiding issues by using with-open-file And this leads on to one of the potential issues with open , the programmer has to remember to always close the stream that gets opened , and ensure it gets closed even in the event of errors. When streams are left open, results may be unpredictable and performance often suffers. For this reason, the macro with-open-file is much preferred. It takes a symbol representing a stream and a path to the file as required arguments plus all of the keyword arguments used by open , plus a body of expressions. with-open-file opens the stream, evaluates the body of expressions (which will invariably refer to the stream), and then closes the stream.

Care should be taken when using this message since it may impact reusability of an object if the object is used in multiple places and this is used to reference a particular slot/message in the parent object; if the object can be used by mutiple objects then it implies that slot/message must be supported wherever this is used as a child object GDL-USER> (setq self (make-object 'name-display)) #NAME-DISPLAY #x210408140D> GDL-USER> (setq self (the my-named-object)) #<BOX #x2104080FFD> GDL-USER> (the parent) #NAME-DISPLAY #x210408140D> Application Debugging/Inspection type - returns the type of the current object GDL-USER> (setq self (make-object 'name-display)) #NAME-DISPLAY #x210408140D> GDL-USER> (the type) #NAME-DISPLAY #x210408140D> GDL-USER> (setq self (the my-named-object)) #<BOX #x2104080FFD> GDL-USER> (the type) #<BOX #x2104080FFD> all-mixins - returns a list of the mixins used by the current-object.

:settable slots :settable slots <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> In the Getting Started with GendL tutorial, we identified on of the biggest differences between GendL and other programming languages was that slot evaluation was always demand driven and the inbuilt dependency tracker will always ensure slot values are current whenever any input changes. This removes a big burdon from the developer and also ensures run times are fast, as we are never calculating any values we don't need to use. However, there may be times when we need to make programatic changes to values an over-ride this default behaviour. To do this, we identify either slots as :settable and then we use the set-slot! function to programaically alter the value of the selected slot. When we make a change to a slot value by programatically setting it, the dependency tracker is aware of this and any changes which would ordinarily cause the value to be updated are suspended.

matically setting it, the dependency tracker is aware of this and any changes which would ordinarily cause the value to be updated are suspended. If we want to reverse this behaviour (back to default) we can use either of the restore-slot-default! or restore-slot-defaults! functions As with a lot of different techniques, programatically altering slot values and over-riding the default behaviour has its place and is a useful additoon to the tools and techniques available to the programmer. However, we need to be aware that at the point we do this, and until we revert to default behaviour, it becomes to responsibility of the developer to manage dependencies.

For this reason it is recommended to use this technique sparingly and only when a solution using the default behaviour will not give the desired results Consider the following code (define-object settable-slots (base-object) :computed-slots ((speed 25 :settable) (time 15 :settable) (distance (* (the speed) (the time)) :settable)) :functions ((set-speed! (&key (value 20)) (the (set-slot! :speed value))) (set-time! (&key (value 10)) (the (set-slot! :time value))) (set-distance! () (the (set-slot! :distance 100))) (reset-distance! () (the (restore-slot-default! :distance))) (reset-all! () (the (restore-slot-defaults! (list :speed :time :distance)))))) 3 :computed slots , speed , time and distance have been tagged as :settable . 5 functions have been defined, 3 which set new values (using set-slot! ) for the respective slots and 2 which will restore default values and behaviours (using :restore-slot-default! and :restore-slot-defaults! ).

GendL Application - BASE-VIEW Package Documentation Object: BASE-VIEW (The :GEOM-BASE Package) Mixins: BASE-OBJECT Description Generic container object for displaying a scaled transformed view of geometric or text-based objects. Base-view can be used by itself or as a child of a base-drawing In a GWL application-mixin, you can include an object of this type in the ui-display-list-leaves. For the PDF output-format, you can also use the cad-output output-function to write the view as a PDF document. Since base-view is inherently a 2D object, only the top view (getf *standard-views* :top) makes sense for viewing it. Input Slots (optional) ANNOTATION-OBJECTS list of gdl objects These objects will be displayed in each view by default, with no scaling or transform (i.e. they are in Drawing space. BORDER-BOX? boolean Determines whether a rectangular border box is drawn around the view, with the view's length and width. Defaults to nil.

BOUNDING-BOX [ from BASE-OBJECT ] list of two 3d points The left front bottom and right rear top corners, in global coordinates, of the rectangular volume bounding the tree of geometric objects rooted at this object. CENTER 3d-point Center of the view box. Specify this or corner, not both. note: that the center is no longer defaulting (so that it can self-compute properly when corner is specified), so it is necessary to explicitly give either start or center for base-view. CORNER 3d-point Top left (i.e. rear left from top view) of the view box. Specify this or center, not both. FRONT-MARGIN number in drawing scale (e g. points). Amount of margin on front and rear of page when view-scale is to be computed automatically. Defaults to 25.

GendL Application - TYPESET-BLOCK Package Documentation Object: TYPESET-BLOCK (The :GEOM-BASE Package) Mixins: BASE-OBJECT Description Block of text typeset using cl-typesetting. This object wraps the typeset block as a standard GDL object, so it can be placed in a view and positioned according to normal GDL positioning. You can specify the width, and by default this object will compute its length automatically from the typeset content, to fit all the lines of text into the box. Because of this computed behavior of the length, the center of the box will not, in general, be in a known location compared to the start of the text. Because of this it is recommended to use :corner, rather than :center, for positioning a base-view which contains a typeset block. In the normal case, if you want a single block in a view on a drawing, you should make the base-view object have the same width and length as the typeset-block.

oid This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in the respondent of a form, to do some processing before the respondent's write-html-sheet function runs to present the object. This can be useful especially for objects which are subclasses of higher-level mixins such as application-mixin and node-mixin , where you do not have direct access to the write-html-sheet function and typically only define the model-inputs function. It is not always reliable to do processing in the model-inputs function, since some slots which depend on your intended modifications may already have been evaluated by the time the model-inputs function runs. BEFORE-RESPONSE!

Note that asdf: (Another System Definition Utility), possibly with help of Quicklisp, is (as of 2013-03-12) the recommended way for handling Common Lisp system modules. As of version 2.31.9, ASDF is also capable of generating fasl "bundle" files as with the :create-fasl? argument to cl-lite. For the :author, :version, and :license arguments in the generated .asd file, the files author.isc, version.isc, and license.isc, respectively, are consulted, if they exist. They are searched for first in the codebase toplevel directory (the pathname argument to this function), then in the (user-homedir-pathname). The version defaults to the current ISO-8601 date without dashes, e.g. "20130312". Please see the Genworks Documentation for an overview of Quicklisp and ASDF, and see the Quicklisp and ASDF project documentation for detailed information.

GendL Application - QUANTIFICATION Package Documentation Object: QUANTIFICATION (The :GENDL Package) Mixins: VANILLA-MIXIN Description A quantification is an aggregate created as a result of specifying :sequence (:size ...)) or :sequence (:indices ...)) in an :objects specification. Usually, the elements of a quantified set are referenced by using extra parentheses around the message in the reference chain and using the index number. But the aggregate itself also supports certain messages, documented here. One message, number-of-elements , is not listed in the normal messages section because it is internal. It can be used, and returns an integer representing the cardinality of the aggregate. Input Slots (optional) HIDDEN? [ from VANILLA-MIXIN* ] boolean Indicates whether the object should effectively be a hidden-object even if specified in :objects. Default is nil. ROOT [ from VANILLA-MIXIN* ] gdl instance The root-level node in this object's ``tree'' (instance hierarchy).

There is also an undocumented function called make-gdl-app ; in order to perform a runtime build process, simply make an instance of this object with the appropriate input values, and invoke (the make!) on it, or call make-gdl-app with the same arguments as the input-slot you give to this object. Input Slots (optional) APPLICATION-FASLS list of pathnames This list should contain the pre-compiled fasls for your GDL application, in correct load order. These can be produced, for example, by calling genworks:cl-lite with the :create-fasl? keyword argument set to t .

BEFORE-PRESENT! void This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in the respondent of a form, to do some processing before the respondent's write-html-sheet function runs to present the object. This can be useful especially for objects which are subclasses of higher-level mixins such as application-mixin and node-mixin , where you do not have direct access to the write-html-sheet function and typically only define the model-inputs function. It is not always reliable to do processing in the model-inputs function, since some slots which depend on your intended modifications may already have been evaluated by the time the model-inputs function runs.

GendL Application - SKELETON-UI-ELEMENT Package Documentation Object: SKELETON-UI-ELEMENT (The :GWL Package) Mixins: VANILLA-MIXIN Description Basic mixin to support constructing a gdl ajax call relative to this node. Note that in order for a node to represent a section of a web page, you should use sheet-section (which mixes this in), rather than this raw primitive. This is a mixin into base-html-sheet, and some of the previous base-html-sheet functionality has been factored out into this mixin. Of special note in this object is the function gdl-ajax-call which generates Javascript appropriate for attaching with a UI event, e.g. onclick, onchange, onblur, etc. In this Javascript you can specify a GDL function (on this object, self) to be run, and/or specify a list of form-control objects which are rendered on the current page, whose values should be submitted and processed ("bashed") into the server.

Input Slots (optional) BASHEE gdl object Object to have its settable computed-slots and/or query-plist set from the fields on the form upon submission. Defaults to self. DOM-ID string This is the auto-computed dom-id which should be used for rendering this section. If you use the main-div HTML string for rendering this object as a page section, then you do not have to generate the :div tag yourself - the main-div will be a string of HTML which is wrapped in the correct :div tag already. FORCE-VALIDATION-FOR list of gdl objects of type form-control The validation-function will be forced on these objects when a form is submitted, even if the object's html form-control does not happen to be included in the values submitted with the form.

It requires the geom-base module to be loaded. This will probably be extended to allow more than one graphics area. This mixin inherits from base-html-sheet, so just like with base-html-sheet you can prepare the output with the write-html-sheet function in a the object which mixes this in, or in a main-sheet output-function in an html-format view of the object. Input Slots (optional) AFTER-PRESENT!

If you want to define your own main-sheet, then there is no use for base-ajax-sheet, you can just use base-html-sheet. But then you have to include any needed Javascript yourself, e.g. for gdl-ajax-call support or jQuery. The html-format lens for base-ajax-sheet also defines a user hook function, main-sheet-body, which produces a "No Body has been defined" message by default, but which you can fill in your own specific lens to do something useful for the body.

GWL will process the data types according to specific rules, and validate the typed value according to other default rules. A custom validation-function can also be provided by user code. Sequences of these objects (with :size, :indices, :matrix, and :radial) are supported. This facility and its documentation is expected to undergo significant and frequent upgrades in the remainder of GDL 1573 and upcoming 1575. Current to-do list: Currently this works with normal HTTP form submission and full page reloading.

mainder of GDL 1573 and upcoming 1575. Current to-do list: Currently this works with normal HTTP form submission and full page reloading. We intend to make it work with AJAX and surgical page update as well. We intend to provide inputs for all the standard tag attributes for the accompanying LABEL tag for the form control. Additional form control elements to be included, to cover all types of form elements specified in current HTML standard from http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.2.1 button-form-control: submit buttons, reset buttons, push buttons. checkbox-form-control: checkboxes, radio buttons (multiple of these must be able to have same name) menu-form-control: select, along with optgroup and option. text-form-control: single-line text input (including masked passwords) and multi-line (TEXTAREA) text input. file-form-control: file select for submittal with a form. hidden-form-control: input of type hidden.

Also, we have to study and clarify the issue of under what conditions values can possibly take on nil values, and what constitutes a required field as opposed to a non-validated field, and whether a blank string on a text input should be represented as a nil value or as an empty string. Note that checkbox-form-control and menu-form-control currently get automatically included in the possible-nils.

This tutorial cover the basics of delivering web pages and linking them with applications. Note: The examples in this Tutorial depend on some patches to the GWL component of GendL which may not yet be built into the GendL distribution you are currently running. These patches can be loaded from the source file gwl-patches.lisp in the Resources section of the first slide linked below.

form control entered value to be captured. The simplest, and reccomended, way to do this, is to use the :ajax-submit-on-change? input to the form control. With this set to T whenever the form control value is changed an AJAX update will be performed to submit the form and capture the value. We'll cover using AJAX in the next topic. Resetting a form control Every form constrol support a function restore-defaults! which sets :value , :failed-value and :error back to default values Validating inputs All form controls have a :validation-function input. This function defines the rule(s) against which the provided input is tested to determine if it is valid. Any function may be used, but quite often a lambda function is a good solution as the validation is generally specific to the form control and its applcation.

Uploading files Uploading files <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Uploading files To upload a file we need to submit a form, containing the file, to the server. This is a traditional multipart form submission. Gendl provides the with-form-string macro to create a form. When using this macro for file uploads we must specify the keyword argunemt enctype with a value of multipart/form-data to ensure the file is ransmited to the server correctly Within the body of the form we need two input tags. The first is of type file which gives us a Browse button to enable a file to be selected. Within this tag we also need to assign a :name, the value of which must correspond with the name of a :settable :computed-slot (its symbol name, so preceeded witha : character).

selected text changes to the filename of the selected file. Screenshot after selecting the file, but before hitting Upload If Upload is then clicked the file is uploaded to the server and the text alongside the Browse button will revert to no file selected . As part of this upload, as well as transmitting the file to the server, the slot representing the server pathname to the file (in this case :uploaded-path ) is set. One important thing to note: the default value for uploaded-path is set to an empty string, rather then nil. This is to ensure that when the uploaded-path value is set as part of the upload it is set to a string value and not a symbol - on Windows in particular with a drive letter followed by a : character this will cause problems as Lisp will believe its a package...

It is often useful to conditionalise the display of the Browse and Submit buttons depending on the value of the uploaded file slot and possibly present an alternative button which will reset the form to original values. The code below includes a Reset button to perform the reset. We use the after-set! function, check what values are in the query-plist and if the value of this button ("Reset Form") is present firstly delete the uploaded file if it exists and then run the restore-slot-default! function on upoaded-path (define-object file-upload-2 (base-html-page) :computed-slots ((uploaded-path " " :settable) (body (with-lhtml-string () (str (the development-links)) (when (= (length (the uploaded-path)) 0) (htm (str (with-form-string (:enctype "multipart/form-data ") (:table (:tr (:td (:input :type "file " :name :uploaded-path :value (the uploaded-path)))) (:tr (:td (:input :type "submit " :name "upload " :value "Upload ")))))))) (when (> (length (the uploaded-path)) 0) (htm (str (fmt

Building pages from base-html-divs Building pages from base-html-divs <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> In the Creating and Publishing web pages topic, the slot body was identified as the slot that needed to be populated with a html string in order for the object to be rendered as a web page. The whole page and be defined as a single string in this slot if required, but building a page from base-html-divs may lead to an easier to manage page and encourages modularity and reuse, which in turn provides a common look and feel to pages A base-html-div is an object, which evaluates the div message to a html string and then we include that message in the objects parent body . To populate the div slot, we need to write a html string to the inner-html slot. The base-html-div object then wraps this string with some standard html when div is evaluated.

for now the main thing to take away is how the use of AJAX may affect the granularity of a base-html-div . If a single base-html-div was used for the whole page, then an AJAX update would have only marginal impact on both speed of display and bandwidth used. If every element in the page was its own base-html-div the overhead would be significant. So there's obviously a compromise somewhere in the middle. Best advice would be to group elements likely to be updated as a result of the same event together in the same base-html-div if possible. Resources gwl-patches.lisp using-page-sections.lisp

Creating and Publishing web pages Creating and Publishing web pages | ^UP^ | Next-> Fundamentally, the steps for creating and publishing a web page are: Define an object mixing in base-html-page In that object define a slot called body Assign a string, or a function/macro that evaluates to a string, to the slot body Call the function publish-gwl-app to publish the object to a specified url The above steps are sufficient to spin up the web page while using your currently running GendL development session as the host (server). Running this way, and as described in the rest of this Tutorial, you as well as colleagues/clients on your local private network will be able to access the web page/application as you are developing it. If you want to distribute and scale up your website/application more broadly, then you'd have to arrange for appropriate hosting and devops/continuous integration resources to launch and maintain your site.

re broadly, then you'd have to arrange for appropriate hosting and devops/continuous integration resources to launch and maintain your site. Gorn Skew Infrastructure (a sibling entity to the Gorn School) hopes soon to start offering turnkey hosting services for Gendl applications, so please stay tuned if you are interested. Now on to some examples. Consider the following code (in-package :gwl-user) (define-object sample-page (base-html-page) :computed-slots ((body "My first web page"))) (publish-gwl-app "/sample-page" 'sample-page) The first thing to note is that we are working in the gwl-user package. This is a pre-defined package which gives us access to all the same symbols as gdl-user does, plus some extra web-specific ones.The object is using the base-html-page mixin and we have just assigned a simple string to the body slot. In order to publish the web page, we use the publish-gwl-app function.

To publish the style sheet we have to povide its location in the filesystem. We could do this explicitly, and that may be fine if the code is being developed on the same operating system as it is deployed on.

We would still need to maintain the relative location of the source code folder and the css folder, but if we could do this then the merge-pathnames approach is quite an attractive solution. We choose to define a home directory as the folder above the source code folder and assign it as a parameter *home* so we can access it globally. Having done that we then call the gwl::publish-file function, referencing our stylesheet and publishing it as "/my-style.css" (defparameter *home* (merge-pathnames "../" (make-pathname :name nil :type nil :defaults (glisp:source-pathname)))) (gwl::publish-file :path "/my-style.css" :file (namestring (merge-pathnames "css/my-style.css" *home*))) Next we add a slot to our object called additional-header-content and specify a stylesheet link to the my-style.css.

The most important is probably to include links to enable the object model to be updated dynamically (equivalent to Mode..Update in Geysr or (the update!) in the REPL) and to be able to break on the object model directly from the web page itself (equivalent to Mode..Set Self in Geysr). To do this, we print a predefined slot (the development-links) onto the web page. For convenience its often useful to conditionalise this based on the value of a paremeter indication whether or not we are in development mode.

Wall example - taking inputs from a file Wall example - taking inputs from a file <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> In the tutorial Getting started with GendL we developed an example application to build a model of a building. In that application, all inputs were provided as input-slots with default values. We then extended that in the tutorial Reading from and Writing to Files to take inputs from a file and deliver the output as a file. In this topic, we'll use the building application and extend it to include a web based front end to upload a file via a form. The basic design concept is to have a web page as a top level object, which provides a form to upload an input file. The building application based on file inputs will be a child object of the file upload form, and once the file has been uploaded it will be passed to te building application as an inout.

As we will demand the url of the published file, we can use side effecting to run the file generation and publishing, rather than running them as a function. To do this we use a computed-slot output-url and the body form of the let macro to evaulate the file write and publish functions sequentially. We've also defined the output filename, such that it will be in the same directory as the uploaded file, but with a different name

In this topic, we'll use the wall application and extend it to include a web based front end to gather inputs via a form. The basic design concept is to have a web page as a top level object, which gathers the inputs and passes them to the wall application, which is defined as a child object of the web form. We will then retrieve the outputs from the wall application and display these on the web form So first, we need to familiarise ourselves with the required inputs (define-object wall(box) :input-slots ((brick-height 45) (brick-length 180) (brick-width 90) (mortar-joint-width 10) (wall-length 3700) (wall-height 900)) ...

Note that we use the form-controls slot to iterate through all the form-control objects to present them on the web page. Also we would normally define validation-function inputs, but have skipped those in this example (define-object wall-example-form (base-html-page) :computed-slots ((main-sheet-body (with-lhtml-string () (:table (:tr (:td (str (the form-controls-section div)))))))) :objects ((form-controls-section :type 'base-html-div :inner-html (with-lhtml-string () (:table (dolist (obj (the form-controls)) (htm (:tr (:td (str (theo obj prompt))) (:td (str (theo obj form-control))))))))) ... )) Then we need to link the form-control value slots to the :inputs to the wall object (define-object wall-example-form (base-html-page) ...

Because all of the form-control objects have been defined with :ajax-submit-on-change? set to T, any change to the form inputs will automatically trigger an update to the outputs display (define-object wall-example-form (base-html-page) :computed-slots ((main-sheet-body (with-lhtml-string () (:table (:tr (:td (str (the form-controls-section div))) (:td (str (the report-section div))))))) ) :objects ( ... ...

Using AJAX Using AJAX <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> What is AJAX? AJAX is a term you don't hear much anymore but it originally stood for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML." This is technique for updating one or more sections of a web page based on a request sent to the web server. Early web applications were limited to transmitting information to and from the sever using synchronous requests, one page at a time. It means your user would fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server. With AJAX, when you click a button, change a value, or do certain other interactions with a page, the JavaScript engine running in your browser will make a request to the server, which interprets the results and sends a response, then the JavaScript engine will update the user's web page accordingly. The user would not be directly made aware that anything was transmitted to and from the server.

ate the user's web page accordingly. The user would not be directly made aware that anything was transmitted to and from the server. Using AJAX with GendL The most basic requirement is to use base-html-page as your web pages mixin. This provides most of the functionality, and was covered in the first topic of this tutorial, Creating and Publishing web pages Next, to trigger an AJAX submit, form controls need to have their input :ajax-submit-on-change? set to T. This was covered in the tutorial topic Gathering inputs using form-controls And finally, the page is best constructed from base-html-divs , as shown in the topic Building pages from base-html-divs Performance Considerations The javascript update is performed by GendL at the base-html-div level; GendL identifies which base-html-divs will be impacted by the change to the form control(s), recomputes the value of the base-html-divs div and updates the page with that content.

will be impacted by the change to the form control(s), recomputes the value of the base-html-divs div and updates the page with that content. So for best performance there is a balance to be struck between having sufficient base-html-divs so that large sections of the page which don't change are updated and sent from the server to the browser, and having the page defined with so much granularity that a large number of (smaller) inserts/updates have to be made In the main, however, any optimisation can be performed at the end of the development cycle although it is worth bearing in mind the simplicity/granularity tradeoff when building the page in the first place. This was also discussed in the topic Building pages from base-html-divs Using AJAX with GendL is really this simple!

Using with-lhtml-string Using with-lhtml-string <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> LHTML is a Markup Language included in Gendl (standing for Lisp HTML ) which provides a convenient way to generate html using lisp-like expressions. It is intended to be portable and shoud work with all ANSI standard Common Lisp Implementations. The main element of lhtml is the macro with-lhtml-string , which transforms its body into a html string In general, we use with-lhtml-string when creating html strings for use in GWL web pages with-lhtml-string takes an optional input :indent . By default it is nil which results in html with no unnecessary whitespace to minimise the bandwith being used. But for debugging purposes, the resulting html may be difficult to read.

While a wall instance can be specified using nominal dimensions for length and height, the actual dimensions may vary slightly in order to use a whole number of bricks per row. Vertically adjacent rows of bricks are offset by half a brick with respect to the row below and so will consist of a half-brick at the beginning and a half-brick at the end of the row (i.e. row). Define and instantiate a GendL model of a wall which has a default nominal height of 900mm and a nominal length of 3700mm, and report the number of full bricks and number of half bricks used.

Geysr is particularly helpful when working with geometry, as it includes a viewport for rendering the geometry. Assuming the Gendl web server is running on port 9000, Geysr may be accessed at http://localhost:9000/geysr . When Geysr is opened, a splash screen is displayed: To instantiate a compiled object, select: File..New , and in the text field enter the desired package name and the object type name separated by :: For the example code in the Resources section, this will be gdl-user::my-box-1 . Press Enter to instantiate the object. The object will be instantiated, and all of its available slots will be displayed in the Inspector pane in the lower Left-hand section of the browser window. Note that most slots will initially be shown as unbound .

forms one of the steps of a five-step iterative process you'll typically follow when developing using Geysr: Author your desired code (new code or changes to existing code). Compile the code and load it into the running session (compiling is optional but recommended). Update the instance in the running Geysr session to reflect the new code. Inspect and poke around with the results in the various panes of Geysr Based on said results, return to Step 1 above and repeat. Your typical development session will include many iterations of the above five steps. Depending on the situation at hand it is possible to complete a single iteration very quickly, sometimes in less than one minute. This rapid iteration potential is one of the upsides of becoming proficient with GendL combined with Geysr. A Note on Symbol Names Note that object type names in Gendl (as in Common Lisp) have two parts: a Package name a Symbol name These can be written together separated by a double colon ( :: ).

Note on Symbol Names Note that object type names in Gendl (as in Common Lisp) have two parts: a Package name a Symbol name These can be written together separated by a double colon ( :: ). For example, the symbol naming our my-box-1 definition was introduced into the system while the gdl-user package was active, or "current" — therefore you can refer to this definition with the fully qualified symbol name: gdl-user :: my-box-1 Sometimes it is possible to use a single colon ( : ) rather than a double colon ( :: ), and often it is possible to omit the package name entirely when referring to a symbol. That's enough on Packages and Symbols for now. You will learn more about Packages and Symbols later. Resources my-box-1.lisp

Formatted output Formatted output <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> When we want more control, flexibility and sophistication with text output we use the format function below are some of the most commonly used and useful features of format , but it can sometimes be difficult to understand or read, due to its compactness and its non-Lispy syntax. A great resource on the Internet is an article by Peter Seibel, called a few FORMAT recipes which provides a detailed discussion on the features and uses of format and some very useful examples. See the link in the resources section Format takes 2 required arguments A destination for its output A control string that will generally contain literal text, but will always contain format directives . Format will also generally be provided with extra arguments which are used by the directives in the control string. Output Destination The output destination is the first argument to format.

which are used by the directives in the control string. Output Destination The output destination is the first argument to format. There are 4 types of output destination, but we'll discuss just the first 3 If the value is T , the output destination is the *standard-output* stream If the value is NIL , the output is generated as a string and returned by format If the destination is a stream, the output will be written to that stream Control String The control string may look complex because it is based on characters, not s-expressions, and is optimised for compactness. In many ways it is another mini-programming language within Lisp. As well as containing literal text, the control string contains format directives . All directives start with a tilde (~) character, and end with a single character. This character can be either upper of lower case Some directives take prefix parameters , between the tilde and the character.

aracter. This character can be either upper of lower case Some directives take prefix parameters , between the tilde and the character. If more than one prefix parameter is used they are separated by commas (,). Prefix parameters give additional output control Some directives use either the colon (:) or at-sign (@) modifiers which change the behavior of the directive in small ways There are also some special directives which are used in pairs and can be wrapped around other directives , e.g. to control capitalisation ( ~( ~) ), conditional formatting ( ~[ ~] ) or iteration ( ~{ ~} ) This list isn't exhaustive, but contains the most frequently used principles. Basic Formatting The most basic directive is ~a . It consumes one of the format arguments and outputs it in human-readable form. Note that because we are using NIL as the output destination , format is returning a string as return-value and not outputting anywhere.

e that because we are using NIL as the output destination , format is returning a string as return-value and not outputting anywhere. Another basic directive is ~% , which causes a newline to be emitted. It optionally takes a single prefix parameter that defines how many newlines to be emitted GDL-USER> (setq text "Hello") "Hello" GDL-USER> (setq number 123.456) 123.456 GDL-USER> (setq my-list (list 1 2 3)) (1 2 3) GDL-USER> (format nil "~a" text) "Hello" GDL-USER> (format nil "~a" number) "123.456" GDL-USER> (format nil "~a" my-list) "(1 2 3)" GDL-USER> (format nil "Line 1~%Line2") "Line 1 Line 2" GDL-USER> (format nil "Line 1~%Line2") "Line 1 Line 2" Integer Directives Whist the directive ~a can be used to output numbers, the directive ~d offers more control for outputting integers (d standing for decimal, or base 10).

The difference is ~f is alowed to use scientific notation if the number is large enough or small enough, whilst ~e will always emit the number argument in scientific notation. There are a number of prefix parameters , but the only one of real significance is the second, which specifies the number of digits to output after the decimal point. Note that, if this prefix parameter is less than the number of decimal digits in the argument, the argument will be mathematically rounded. A third floating point number directive is ~$ which is a monetary directive.

Iteration and Mapping Iteration and Mapping <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Common Lisp provides a number of iteration and mapping macros and functions which enable us to process the contents of lists, the most commonly used being Iteration - the macros dolist and dotimes Mapping - the functions mapcar , mapcan and mapc Common Lisp also defines 2 powerful and more general iteration macros, do/do* and loop , but they are outside the scope of this tutorial Iteration Macros dolist - takes a list of a variable and an expression which returns a list , followed by a body of expressions . Optionally dolist can take a third element for its list, which is an expression which will be evaluated and its value returned from the dolist expression once the dolist iteration has completed. The body of expressions is evaluated with the variable bound to successive elements in the list. The example on the right first sets a return variable res to nil .

ns is evaluated with the variable bound to successive elements in the list. The example on the right first sets a return variable res to nil . It then iterates through the list a , multiplying each value by 5 and pushing the result onto res . Finally res is returned from the dolist and set to b . If you wanted to return the resultant list values in the same order as they occur in the input list, you would need to wrap the dolist return value res in a call to the function reverse . But because res is locally bound and will never be used after b has been evaluated, you could use the destructive function nreverse , which is slightly more efficient than reverse GDL-USER> (setq a (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)) 1 2 3 4 5 6) GDL-USER> (setq b (let ((res nil)) (dolist (var a res) (push (* var 5) res)))) (30 25 20 15 10 5) GDL-USER> (setq b (let ((res nil)) (dolist (var a (nreverse res)) (push (* var 5) res)))) (5 10 15 20 25 30) It is also possible to use dolist without any return value argument, in

This effectively allows functions to be defined on the fly and they can be used to map across multiple lists. The first example is an alternative to the dotimes example for splicing 2 lists together. Successive elements from the 2 input lists are bound to the lambda vailables x and y and the return value from the lambda expression appended to the return list.

Height may be specified explicitly as Ht mm, or an angle D degrees may be specified (one or the other, if both are specified then the H dimension should be used. A sketch of the design is shown. For a given beam dimension (H X W X t) and overall truss dimensions (H x L or L with a D degree slope), calculate the total mass of the truss. If it is made from steel which has a density of 7800 kg/m 3 and the cost of the beam is £450 per metric tonne, calculate the mass of the truss and the material cost.

The direction-keywords can be one of: :lateral , :longitudinal , or :vertical . In this tutorial we will cover only standard and radial sequences. When a sequence is generated, each object is assigned a zero-based index number.

Likewise, from inside the :objects specification, each child can reference its own index slot (or any other of its slots) by using the reference macro the-child .

Its takes a list and start position and optionally an end position, returning a list comprising the elements from and including the start position up to but excluding the end position.

GendL therefore defines a function safe-sort which mirrors sort in every respect apart from it does not modify the input list .

Numbers and Arithmetic Numbers and Arithmetic <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> In the Defining Objects section, we briefly touched on numbers and arithmetic (define-object my-box-4 (box) :input-slots (length (width 4) (height 4))) :computed-slots ((density 7800) (mass (* (div (the volume) 1000000000) (the density))))) In this section we will take a bit more detailed look at how GendL handles numbers and arithmetic. The majority of this is pure Common Lisp (CL), although GendL does define a few Convenience Functions which may be classed as arithmetic. CL has four number types: Integers (e.g. 1 , 38 , 183749372628 ) Floating Point (e.g. 253.67 , 2.52E+26 ) Ratios (e.g. 6/7 , 347/395 ) Complex (e.g.

(#C(0 5) , representing the square root of -25) In contrast with other languages, you don't need to worry too much about the type of number you are using, as the CL runtime system will sort that out for us (unless you need to intervene for specific performance reasons by bypassing the dynamic typing feature). CL can handle rational numbers with "infinite" precision. For example, the number 1/3 represents one-third with no loss of precision as happens with the decimal representation of 0.33333... truncated to some arbitray number of decimal places. And there is no realistic limit on the maximum size of a number that CL can represent (although Integers up to a certain size may be processed more efficiently than arbitrarily huge Integers). Arithmetic functions There are four basic CL arithmetic functions + - * / Additionally GendL defines a fifth: div and two shortcut functions half twice As with all Lisp dialects, CL uses prefix notation for functions.

Functions and :functions Functions and :functions <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Functions and :functions <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Functions are Lisp objects which can be called , or invoked, to accept some inputs (or "arguments") and yield corresponding outputs or "return values." Typically, functions will simply return new values without modifying any of the inputs. If you program mostly with such a non-modifying style, you are doing _Functional Programming. GendL offers two kinds of functions: Functions defined using the defun macro, Sometimes called Named Functions , such functions become objects in memory which have a symbol for a name. Usually, variables mentioned within the body of such functions are "passed in" to the function call as arguments, Variables with Global and Dynamic Scope can also be accessed within function bodies, but we will cover those types of variables later. Functions defined within the :functions section of a GendL object definition.

e can also be accessed within function bodies, but we will cover those types of variables later. Functions defined within the :functions section of a GendL object definition. As with toplevel defun functions, variables may be passed into :functions as arguments and the function bodies may access global data. But additionally, :functions can also access any other messages defined within the same GendL object type where they occur. Messages can be any of :input-slots :computed-slots :objects ... and other :functions also count as messages! When you want to access the value of other mesages within the same object instance, you can use the the referencing macro . Named functions We have already encountered a number of Named Functions, for example + which returns the sum of the numbers supplied as arguments length which returns the length of a list supplied as an argument Named functions defined using the defun macro use Prefix Notation .

In other words, the function name is specified first, followed by its arguments. Named functions can accept Specific standard arguments, which immediately follow the function name Specific optional arguments, identified using &optional in the argument list Specific keyword arguments, identified using &key in the argument list Any number of remaining arguments, identified using &rest in the argument list We'll discuss standard, &optional and &keyword arguments in this tutorial and come back to &rest arguments in a later tutorial Standard arguments Here we define two functions with one and two arguments respectively.

of them, a bit less easy if there are two, and will start becoming unwieldy to work with if you use more than 2 Optional arguments. Additionally, thought needs to be given to the order in which they are defined to avoid having to specify optional arguments just to occupy a space in the argument list (e.g. if you have two optional arguments, list first the one which is more likely to be passed in as a non-default value in calls to that function. Keyword arguments work well when the function has more than 1 argument, and help with readability Optional and Keyword arguments are relatively 'expensive' at runtime compared with Standard arguments, so particularly with Keyword arguments you may be trading Convenience for Speed in some cases (such cases can be shaken out with Runtime Profiling) GendL object :functions A GendL object function is defined in the :functions section of an object definition made with the define-object macro.

The syntax for define-object is: (define-object definition-name ([mixins*]) [specifications*]) where: definition-name is a symbol naming the object being defined. mixins* means zero or more symbols naming other object definitions, from which this object type will inherit characteristics. specifications* comprise the body of the object definition and consist of a set of keyword-value pairs which describe the characteristics and behaviors of any given instance of the object type. mixins In the above example, my-box-1a specifies box as a mixin. Because box includes a built-in slot volume , my-box-1a will also include a volume slot.

ny given instance of the object type. mixins In the above example, my-box-1a specifies box as a mixin. Because box includes a built-in slot volume , my-box-1a will also include a volume slot. The primitive box also includes length , width and height , but specifies their default values each to be 0 . In the example above, because my-box-1a also includes length , width , and height , and assigns default values to them ( 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively), these values override the default 0 values in any instances we may make of my-box-1a as long as we do not feed in any other specific values at instantiation-time.

Each input-slot may be a symbol In this case it is a required input for the object. a symbol-value pair enclosed in parentheses in this case the slot is provided with a default value which may be overridden by passing in a different value, either from the parent object or from a toplevel call to the make-object function. In the example below, length is required, but width and height each default to 4 . (define-object my-box-4 (box) :input-slots (length (width 4) (height 4))) If my-box-4 is instantiated, and length (or any attribute which depends on length ) is evaluated, then an error will result, as length does not have a value.

Equality Equality <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Lisp defines 4 generic equality predicates. In order of "strictness" they are: eq eql equal equalp When we say eq is the strictest test, we mean that it is most likely to return NIL . So any two items which compare as T with eq will certainly compare as T with eql and with all the other equality predicates below eql in the stack. A similar relationship may be drawn between eql and equal , and likewise between equal and equalp . Now we will show some examples and describe the characteristics of each of these equality predicates. eq eq takes 2 objects as arguments and returns t if they are identical Integers and Characters have the same symbol-name and value, so when comparing Integers and Characters, whilst it may appear eq is testing for value equality, it is in fact testing for object equality. eq is fast but is only safe to use when the types (i.e.

It assumes a standard GendL installation and setup which provides Emacs and will start the GendL web server on localhost port 9000. The tutorial makes use of GendL's built-in wireframe geometry (the geom-base package) to demonstrate some of the basic concepts of GendL. It also covers most of the Common Lisp (CL) basics that you will need to master in order to work with GendL effectively. What you will not need is to become a CL expert or specialist in order to excel as a GendL user, as GendL does much of the language "heavy lifting" for you.

The 3 sides of the structure are brick walls and should be keyed together where they join and have a flush face at the open edge. The brick structure should be 3m wide, 4m long and 3m high (nominal dimension), the roof slope should be 30 degrees. The roof truss beams are 40mm wide and 50mm tall, with a wall thickness of 3mm and a density of 7800 kg/m 3 . They should be equally spaced, no more than 1.5m apart and the minimum number of roof trusses should be used subject to there being at least 2. Cladding should be added to the roof, such that it touches on the apex and overhangs at the front, rear and sides by 50mm.

Positioning and Orientation Positioning and Orientation <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> Positioning and Orientation <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> For geometric objects, GendL has a Cartesian axis system to specify coördinates in the X, Y and Z dimensions. When specifying a geometric object, a number of basic principles apply: The axis system applies to the object, but may be moved or re-oriented relative to other objects. The center of the object is co-incident with the origin of its axis system #(0.0 0.0 0.0) . The length dimension of the geometric object correponds with the Y axis. The width dimension of the geometric object corresponds with the X axis. The height dimension of the geometric object corresponds with the Z axis. Positioning By default, the positioning of the center point of a child object is identical to the center point of its parent. (This is because center is declared internally to be trickle-down .

We will cover more about trickle-down-slots and the defaulting slot modifier later. If you would like to override the default center which "trickles down" from the parent or a higher ancestor in the tree, then you may position them explicitly, either in an absolute manner (i.e. relative to the global coördinate system), or in a relative manner (i.e. relative to another object, typically the direct parent), by feeding an explicit :center input into the child. Depending on how you specify that :center , the child will end up positioned relative to the parent (or to another object), or relative to the global coördinate system.

Note in this case the parent ( assembly-1 ) is defined to include the base-object mixin - this provides the basic coördinate system without providing any explicit geometry. box-2 defines an explicit center using the GendL make-point macro. The coördinates of this point are defined in absolute global coördinates by passing numbers directly into that make-point macro.

When you create a box for example (whose reference box is identical with itself), the faces of the box are identified as :top , :bottom , :left , :right , :front and :rear Various points relative to the bounding-box may then be accessed using the GendL :functions face-center , edge-center and vertex , whilst vectors may be created normal to a face using the GendL :function face-normal-vector .

So if you wished to position the 3 boxes in assemby-3 such that the rear and front faces of adjoining boxes were coincident, you could achieve that with the following code: (define-object assembly-3 (base-object) :objects ((box-1 :type 'box :length 5 :width 1 :height 1) (box-2 :type 'box :length 10 :height 5 :width 3 :center (translate-along-vector (the box-1 (face-center :rear)) (the box-1 (face-normal-vector :rear)) (half (the-child length)))) (box-3 :type 'box :length 5 :height 5 :width 5 :center (translate-along-vector (the box-2 (face-center :rear)) (the box-2 (face-normal-vector :rear)) (half (the-child length))))) Two important concepts are also introduced here When referencing a GendL function, you can use a normal referencing chain, but if the function has arguments then you need to wrap that function and its arguments in parentheses.

In the case of box-2 and box-3 , we want to translate the point by half of each one's own length . These points and vectors could, of cource be computed explicitly in the parent object. However by computing them using expressions relative to the child instances, you can ensure that the design will "hang together" as intended, i.e. that front and rear faces of adjoining boxes will continue to be touching, even if the center and/or orientation of the first box is changed. Orientation By default, the orientation of a child object is the same as that for its parent object.

However, you can override that by specifying an :orientation as an input to the child instance. To compute an orientation, you can use the GendL alignment function , which will yield an orientation by aligning one, two, or three specified axes of our child instance with one, two, or three specified vectors. If you compute those specified vectors relative to the coördinate system of the current self (i.e. the parent , then the resultant orientation will also end up relative and will automatically respond to any changes.

The alignment function requires at least one axis-vector pair, but optionally can accept an additional two axis-vector pairs, providing the second axis is orthogonal to the first and the third axis is orthogonal to the first and second In the example below, the :rear axis of box-2 (aligned with the global positive Y axis, #(0.0 1.0 0.0) , is aligned with the vector normal to the :top face of box-1 . The center of each box remains the default #(0.0 0.0 0.0) .

GendL Introduction GendL Introduction <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> What is GendL? GendL is a dynamic, declarative, object-oriented language environment embedded in ANSI Common Lisp (CL). It consists of a collection of predefined objects, code-expansion macros, and functions which you, the GendL application developer, may either use directly or extend, to solve problems of any level of complexity decomposed into manageable units. GendL includes geometric primitives (wireframe, surfaces and solids) and has a built-in web server to facilitate cross-platform deployment. Unlike many other programming languages which execute procedurally line by line, GendL only evaluates expressions when they are demanded, and the object, slot, and function specifications within an object definition can be written in any order. Another useful and distinguishing feature is GendL's built-in runtime dependency tracking.

n in any order. Another useful and distinguishing feature is GendL's built-in runtime dependency tracking. This allows your applicaton code to make modifications to the value of any slot at runtime, and the GendL runtime system will immediately mark any downstream dependent slots as "Unbound", forcing them to be re-computed with fresh data the next time they are demanded. GendL development tools Emacs IDE GendL is provided with a configuration for the Emacs Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called "Slime", or the "Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs." Although any text editor can be used, the Emacs/Slime combination provides a rich and evolving set of features for developing GendL and CL code. Emacs/Slime includes a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL), which is an interactive, editable command prompt connected to a live GendL session (which itself is hosted in a running CL process). You will find that the REPL proves useful for testing and debugging code as you are writing it.

command prompt connected to a live GendL session (which itself is hosted in a running CL process). You will find that the REPL proves useful for testing and debugging code as you are writing it. Emacs also boasts a wide range of open-source plugins for customization and automation, including plugins for the emerging AI coding assistants such as Github Copilot. YADD Hyperlinked documentation for the objects, macros, functions, and global parameters provided with GendL is available through any web browser using YADD, a documentation generator built using... GendL. Assuming you have a running session which is using port 9000 for its webserver listener, then reference documentation for the developer will be accessible at [http://localhost:9000/yadd](http://localhost:9000/yadd). YADD may also be used to document your own user-defined objects, macros, functions, and global parameters.

The resulting documentation available on the main YADD home page side by side with that for the built-in operators. In the picture on the right, you can see documentation links for built-in GendL packages such as CL-LITE, GENDL, GEOM-BASE, GEYSR, GWL and YADD, as well as user-defined packages such as PURSUIT-ANALYSIS, WEB-PARTS, and WIND-TUNNEL. From time to time, supplemental documentation may be published at [the Genworks Website](https://genworks.com/documentation){target="_new"}. Geysr As code is developed it may be evaluated in the CL Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). Additionally, GendL provides a model and object browser called Geysr. This is a web-based UI which allows objects to be instantiated, navigated and inspected.

, navigated and inspected. Assuming you have a running session which is using port 9000 for its webserver listener, then Geysr will be available at [http://localhost:9000/geysr](http://localhost:9000/geysr). Geysr is also integrated with the REPL. By invoking Geysr's "Set Self!" action on any object in the object instance tree displayed Geysr, that object will become bound to a global variable `self`, allowing you to work with that object (including access to its ancestor and descendant instances). As with YADD, Geysr is also built using GendL itself. Resources Useful-Emacs-Key-Combinations.pdf

Instantiating objects in the REPL Instantiating objects in the REPL <-Previous | ^UP^ | Next-> GendL includes a collection of object definitions which you can use directly or customise/enhance to suit particular needs. To work with instances of these objects you may choose to instantiate an object in the REPL. For example, to instantiate a GendL object of type box in the REPL, we call GendL's general-purpose make-object constructor function, which yields a freshly instantiated object which we assign to a symbol ( my-box ) in the below example), using the Lisp special operator setq . The make-object function takes an object name as its required argument, followed by a "spliced-in" list of alternating slot-names and corresponding desired initial values. This type of list which is made up from alternating key-value pairs is called a plist . You will learn more about plists later.

m alternating key-value pairs is called a plist . You will learn more about plists later. In the example below we are instantiating a wireframe volumetric box and initializing its length , width and height slots to 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively. Using the macro the-object , you can then "send a message" to this object, which yields the current value of the requested slot. GDL-USER> (setq my-box (make-object 'box :length 2 :width 3 :height 4)) #<BOX #x210348222D> GDL-USER> (the-object my-box length) 2 GDL-USER> (the-object my-box width) 3 GDL-USER> (the-object my-box height) 4 Note that setq is a standard CL special operator which takes one or more symbol-value pairs, assigns the respective values to the symbols, and finally returns the last value. GDL-USER> (setq a 1) 1 GDL-USER> (setq b 2 c "three" d nil) NIL GDL-USER> b 2 GDL-USER> c three GDL-USER> d NIL As with most built-in primitives, The GendL box supports a number of built-in messages, for example volume .

To send the volume message to our my-box instance and get its value returned, we will need to use a reference chain . A reference chain consists of a reference operator such as the-object , followed by an expression which is expected to return an object instance (the example below this expression is simply that my-box symbol). GDL-USER> (the-object my-box volume) 24 You can use the abbreviation theo rather than the-object . It does the same thing with less typing. GDL-USER> (theo my-box volume) 24 As an added convenience, you can assign the object to the special variable self rather than to an arbitrarily-named variable.

iable. If you take this approach, then rather than using theo or the-object to refer to an object expression explicitly when sending a message, you now have the option of using the GendL macro the to send a message to the object, and automatically self will be assumed as the object to receive the message. In the following REPL interaction, the last three expressions are equivalent with each other: GDL-USER> (setq self (make-object 'box :length 2 :width 3 :height 4)) #<BOX #x210348242D> GDL-USER> (the volume) 24 GDL-USER> (the-object self volume) 24 GDL-USER> (theo self volume) 24 While self is a normal symbol, it has a special meaning within the context of GendL.

It is fine to use self in the REPL, you should never bind or set/modify self within the body of a GendL object definition (created using the define-object macro) As yet an additional convenience, you can use the built-in GendL function make-self to instantiate an object and set it to the toplevel self , all in one fell swoop: GDL-USER> (make-self 'box :length 1 :width 2 :height 3) #<BOX #x210348242D> GDL-USER> (the volume) 6 GDL-USER> (the-object self volume) 6 GDL-USER> (theo self volume) 6 If you'd like to create a named "blueprint" of an object instance, e.g. for being able to instantiate customized boxes without needing to feed in customized slot values, then you may use GendL's define-object macro. In the example below we are defining a new object my-box , which is effectively a customisation of the default Gendl box object, by specifying box as part of its mixin list .

Common Lisp defines first through to tenth as functions to retrieve the corresponding element of a list GDL-USER> (first a) 1 GDL-USER> (fourth b) 7 The Common Lisp function last returns the last element of a list as a list . To get the last element, use the GendL function lastcar GDL-USER> (last a) (3) GDL-USER> (lastcar a) 3 Finally to return any element in a list, Common Lisp provides the function nth . nth takes an index number and a list and will return the the element at the position in the list defined by the index number. Note that nth is zero-based, so the first element in a list in (nth 0 [list]).

# Gendl Project Structure Best Practices

## Creating a New Project with gendl-skel

The easiest way to create a new Gendl project is using the `gendl-skel` utility. Once Gendl is loaded, you can create a new project with:

```lisp
;; Load the gendl-skel package if not already loaded
(ql:quickload :gendl-skel)

;; Create a new project named "my-project" in the /projects/xfer/ directory
(gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name "my-project" :base-path "/projects/xfer/")
```

This will create a complete project structure with all necessary files.

## Standard Directory Structure

A well-organized Gendl project typically follows this structure:

```
project-name/
  ├── project-name.asd     # ASDF system definition (auto-generated)
  ├── init.lisp            # Initialization file for loading the project
  ├── source/              # Source code directory
  │   ├── package.lisp     # Package definition
  │   ├── file-ordering.isc # Controls file loading order
```

---

## gendl-project-structure.md (chunk 2/5)
Source: gendl-project-guide/gendl-project-structure.md
Type: unknown

```
oject
  ├── source/              # Source code directory
  │   ├── package.lisp     # Package definition
  │   ├── file-ordering.isc # Controls file loading order
  │   └── *.lisp           # Project source files
```

## Package Definition

Use the simplified `gdl:define-package` approach:

```lisp
;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Syntax: Common-Lisp; Package: gdl-user; Base: 10 -*-

(in-package :gdl-user)

(gdl:define-package :your-package-name
  (:export #:assembly)) ;; export other symbols as needed
```

`gdl:define-package` automatically includes `:gdl`, `:gdl-user`, etc., so you don't need to specify them.

## System Loading

The recommended way to load a Gendl project is:

```lisp
;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Syntax: Common-Lisp; Package: gdl-user; Base: 10 -*-

(in-package :gdl-user)

;; Load Quicklisp
(load-quicklisp)

;; Define project path
(defparameter *my-project-path* 
  (make-pathname :name nil :type nil
                :defaults (glisp:source-pathname)))

;
```

```
load-quicklisp)

;; Define project path
(defparameter *my-project-path* 
  (make-pathname :name nil :type nil
                :defaults (glisp:source-pathname)))

;; Generate/update the ASDF system definition if needed
(unless (probe-file (merge-pathnames "my-project.asd" *my-project-path*))
  (cl-lite *my-project-path* :create-asd-file? t))

;; Add to Quicklisp's local projects
(pushnew *my-project-path* ql:*local-project-directories* :test #'equalp)

;; Load the project
(ql:quickload :my-project)
```

## Object Definitions

Gendl objects are defined using `define-object`:

```lisp
(define-object custom-object (parent-class)
  :input-slots
  ([docstring] my-required-input ;; no default, no extra parens, required on instantiation. 
   ([docstring] input-name <default-value-or-expression>)
   ([docstring] another-input <default-value-or-expression>))
   
  :computed-slots
  (([docstring] computed-slot-1 value-or-expression)
   ([docstring] computed-slot-2 value-or-expression))
```

---

## gendl-project-structure.md (chunk 4/5)
Source: gendl-project-guide/gendl-project-structure.md
Type: unknown

```
([docstring] another-input <default-value-or-expression>))
   
  :computed-slots
  (([docstring] computed-slot-1 value-or-expression)
   ([docstring] computed-slot-2 value-or-expression))
   
  :objects
  (([docstring] child-object :type 'some-object-type
                              :parameter-name (value-or-expression)))
```

## Object Referencing

Use `theo` (shorthand for `the-object`) for cleaner reference syntax:

```lisp
;; Instead of:
(the-object my-object slot-name)

;; Use:
(theo my-object slot-name)

;; For nested references:
(theo container child-object slot-name)
```

Note that `(the ...)` is shorthand for `(theo self ...)` and `self` is
implicitly bound to the current object when in the body of a
`define-object` form.


## Tips for Efficient Project Organization

1. **Use file-ordering.isc**: For controlling the order of file loading within a directory.
2. **Leverage cl-lite**: Let it generate the .asd files; never write .asd files manually.
3.

# Gendl Project Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### System Loading Issues

**Problem**: Project won't load with error about missing system
**Solution**: 
- Check that the path in `cl-lite` and `pushnew` calls is correct and
  evaluate `ql:*local-project-directories*` to confirm that your
  expected project directory is listed.
- Verify your ASDF system name matches your project name
- Make sure Quicklisp is loaded first with `(load-quicklisp)`, can
  verify by evaluating `(find-package :ql)`

**Problem**: "The variable X is unbound" errors during loading
**Solution**:
- Check your file loading order in file-ordering.isc
- Ensure dependent objects are defined before objects that use them
- Verify package names in source files match your defined package

### Package Issues

**Problem**: Symbols not found or wrong package errors
**Solution**:
- Check that all source files have the correct `in-package` statement
```

sues

**Problem**: Symbols not found or wrong package errors
**Solution**:
- Check that all source files have the correct `in-package` statement
- Make sure you're using the right package prefix when referencing objects
- Use package-qualified names for functions/objects outside your package
- Export supported symbols from packages with (:export ...) in package.lisp. 
- Use single-colon i.e. `my-package:my-symbol` to specify exported
  symbols outside the package you're currently in.
- Avoid use of double colons (::) to access non-exported symbols;
  question why the symbols aren't exported and whether they should be,
  or whether maybe you should not be accessing if not exported.

### Object Definition Issues

**Problem**: Object not created properly or missing slots
**Solution**:
- Double-check the inheritance hierarchy (mixin list)
- Verify that all required input slots are provided
- Check for typos in slot names

**Problem**: Object child not properly instantiated
**Solution**:

```
e-check the inheritance hierarchy (mixin list)
- Verify that all required input slots are provided
- Check for typos in slot names

**Problem**: Object child not properly instantiated
**Solution**:
- Make sure the child's type is not dependent on (the-child ... ) at
  all [type has to be known in order for `the-child` to work). Use
  :type (:sequence ...) for making a heterogeneous :sequence.
- Check that all required parameters are passed to the child
- Verify that any computed values for the child's parameters are valid

### Reference Issues

**Problem**: Can't access object properties with `the` or `theo`
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're using the correct syntax for references
- For nested references, check each level in the chain
- Verify that the referenced slots actually exist on the object
- Use (defaulting (the[o] ...) <default-value>) if unsure whether a
  message is handled (this avoids "could not handle" errors).

object
- Use (defaulting (the[o] ...) <default-value>) if unsure whether a
  message is handled (this avoids "could not handle" errors).

## Debugging Techniques

1. **Use `message-list`**: Examine the structure of your objects
   ```lisp
(the-object *assembly* (message-list :category :inputs))
(the-object *assembly* (message-list :category :required-input-slots))
(the-object *assembly* (message-list :category :optional-input-slots))
   ```

3. **Check slot values**: Directly check the value of a slot, evaluating slot name at runtime if need be:
   ```lisp
   (let ((my-slot :length))
     (theo *your-object* (evaluate my-slot)))
   ```

## Performance Issues

1. **Large object definitions with endless list of computed-slots**:
   Break them into child objects in which you can hide complexity from
   the parent and just reference relevant results.
2. **Complex computed slots**: Optimize calculations or cache intermediate results
4.

```
ity from
   the parent and just reference relevant results.
2. **Complex computed slots**: Optimize calculations or cache intermediate results
4. **Dependency chains**: Minimize long chains of interdependent slots

## Best Practices for Robust Projects

1. **Use clear naming conventions**: long indentifiers, kebab-case
   (with hyphen separation). Makes debugging easier
2. **Document your code**: Add comments explaining complex logic
3. **Modular design**: Keep related functionality together
4. **Test incrementally**: Build and test in small steps (!)
5. **Use version control**: Track changes to your project

## Common Error Messages and Their Meaning

1. **"Symbol X not found in package Y"**:
   - Symbol is being used without having been exported or
     package-qualified
   - Solution: Export the symbol and use full package qualification
     with single colon.

2. **"Undefined function ... called with arguments ... "**:
```

---

## troubleshooting.md (chunk 6/7)
Source: gendl-project-guide/troubleshooting.md
Type: unknown

```
xport the symbol and use full package qualification
     with single colon.

2. **"Undefined function ... called with arguments ... "**:
   - Function or slot referenced before it's defined (if slot, it
     means no other definitions of that slot in other object
     definitions either -- otherwise it'd be a "... could not handle
     the ... message" (see below)).
   - Solution: Check file loading order or function definition

3. **"... could not handle the ___ message" or "**:
   - Trying to access a slot that doesn't exist
   - Solution: Check slot name spelling and object definition

## Tips for Testing and Validation

1. **Create test fixtures**: Standard objects for testing
2. **Write test functions**: Verify object behavior
3. **Test edge cases**: Ensure objects work with extreme values
4. **Validate inputs**: Check input values before using them
5. **Add debugging messages**: Use format statements for tracing issues

# Gendl-Skel Project Generator Guide

## Overview

Gendl-Skel is a utility for generating skeleton project structures for Gendl applications. It creates a complete directory structure with all necessary files to get your project started.

## Basic Usage

```lisp
;; Load the utility
(ql:quickload :gendl-skel)

;; Create a new project
(gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name "my-awesome-project" :base-path "/projects/xfer/")
```

## Generated Structure

The utility creates the following structure:

```
my-awesome-project/
  ├── my-awesome-project.asd  # Auto-generated ASDF file
  ├── init.lisp               # Project initialization file
  ├── source/                 # Source code directory
      ├── package.lisp        # Package definition
      ├── file-ordering.isc   # File loading order configuration
      └── assembly.lisp       # Main assembly object definition
```

## Generated Files

### init.lisp

The initialization file contains all necessary code to load your project:
```

---

## gendl-skel-guide.md (chunk 2/4)
Source: gendl-project-guide/gendl-skel-guide.md
Type: unknown

```
guration
      └── assembly.lisp       # Main assembly object definition
```

## Generated Files

### init.lisp

The initialization file contains all necessary code to load your project:
- Defines a project path parameter
- Generates an ASDF file if needed
- Adds the project to Quicklisp local projects
- Loads the project
- Creates a default instance for testing

### package.lisp

Defines your project's package and exports the assembly symbol.

### assembly.lisp

Contains a starter assembly object definition with:
- Example input slots with documentation
- Example computed-slots
- Example child objects (a 3D box)
- Default parameters and display controls

### file-ordering.isc

Specifies the correct loading order for source files (package.lisp first).

## Customization

After generating the project, you'll typically:
1. Add your own object definitions to assembly.lisp or create new source files
2. Update the package.lisp file to export additional symbols
3.
```

e project, you'll typically:
1. Add your own object definitions to assembly.lisp or create new source files
2. Update the package.lisp file to export additional symbols
3. Update the file-ordering.isc if you add new source files
4. Modify the default assembly object to suit your needs

## Best Practices

1. **Use as Starting Point**: The generated project is a starting point; customize it to fit your needs.
2. **Keep Object Definitions Modular**: Add new files for complex components.
3. **Update file-ordering.isc**: Remember to update this when adding new files.
4. **Leverage Default Documentation**: The generated files include documentation templates; fill them with detailed descriptions.
5. **Test Incrementally**: Load and test your project after each significant change.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check that your project name is a valid Lisp symbol
- Ensure you have write permissions for the target directory
