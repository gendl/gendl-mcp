PROJECT GENERATION:\n   - Use the gendl-skel utility: (gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name \"my-project\")\n   - This creates a complete project structure with all necessary files\n\n1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:\n   - /project-name/           Root directory\n   - /project-name/source/    Source files\n   - /project-name/*.asd      ASDF system definition\n\n2. PACKAGE DEFINITION:\n   - Use (gdl:define-package :your-package-name) without :use clauses\n   - GDL, GDL-USER, etc. are automatically included\n\n3. SYSTEM LOADING:\n   - Use cl-lite for automatic dependency management\n   - Example:\n     (load-quicklisp)\n     (cl-lite \"/path/to/project/\" :create-asd-file? t)",

OBJECT REFERENCES:\n   - Use \"theo\" instead of \"the-object\" for cleaner syntax\n   - Example: (theo my-object slot-name)\n   - For nested: (theo container child-object slot-name)\n\n5. BEST PRACTICES:\n   - Use file-ordering.isc for controlling file load order\n   - Break complex objects into modular components\n   - Let cl-lite manage ASDF file generation\n\n|#",

This removes a big burdon from the developer and also ensures run times are fast, as we are never calculating any values we don't need to use. However, there may be times when we need to make programatic changes to values an over-ride this default behaviour. To do this, we identify either slots as :settable and then we use the set-slot! function to programaically alter the value of the selected slot. When we make a change to a slot value by programatically setting it, the dependency tracker is aware of this and any changes which would ordinarily cause the value to be updated are suspended.",

This object wraps the typeset block as a standard GDL object, so it can be placed in a view and positioned according to normal GDL positioning. You can specify the width, and by default this object will compute its length automatically from the typeset content, to fit all the lines of text into the box. Because of this computed behavior of the length, the center of the box will not, in general, be in a known location compared to the start of the text. Because of this it is recommended to use :corner, rather than :center, for positioning a base-view which contains a typeset block. In the normal case, if you want a single block in a view on a drawing, you should make the base-view object have the same width and length as the typeset-block.",

If you want to define your own main-sheet, then there is no use for base-ajax-sheet, you can just use base-html-sheet. But then you have to include any needed Javascript yourself, e.g. for gdl-ajax-call support or jQuery. The html-format lens for base-ajax-sheet also defines a user hook function, main-sheet-body, which produces a \"No Body has been defined\" message by default, but which you can fill in your own specific lens to do something useful for the body.",

AJAX is a term you don't hear much anymore but it originally stood for \"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.\" This is technique for updating one or more sections of a web page based on a request sent to the web server. Early web applications were limited to transmitting information to and from the sever using synchronous requests, one page at a time. It means your user would fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server. With AJAX, when you click a button, change a value, or do certain other interactions with a page, the JavaScript engine running in your browser will make a request to the server, which interprets the results and sends a response, then the JavaScript engine will update the user's web page accordingly. The user would not be directly made aware that anything was transmitted to and from the server.",

CL can handle rational numbers with \"infinite\" precision. For example, the number 1/3 represents one-third with no loss of precision as happens with the decimal representation of 0.33333... truncated to some arbitray number of decimal places. And there is no realistic limit on the maximum size of a number that CL can represent (although Integers up to a certain size may be processed more efficiently than arbitrarily huge Integers).

It consists of a collection of predefined objects, code-expansion macros, and functions which you, the GendL application developer, may either use directly or extend, to solve problems of any level of complexity decomposed into manageable units. GendL includes geometric primitives (wireframe, surfaces and solids) and has a built-in web server to facilitate cross-platform deployment. Unlike many other programming languages which execute procedurally line by line, GendL only evaluates expressions when they are demanded, and the object, slot, and function specifications within an object definition can be written in any order.

Once Gendl is loaded, you can create a new project with:\n\n```lisp\n;; Load the gendl-skel package if not already loaded\n(ql:quickload :gendl-skel)\n\n;; Create a new project named \"my-project\" in the /projects/xfer/ directory\n(gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name \"my-project\" :base-path \"/projects/xfer/\")\n```\n\nThis will create a complete project structure with all necessary files.\n\n## Standard Directory Structure\n\nA well-organized Gendl project typically follows this structure:\n\n```\nproject-name/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 project-name.asd     # ASDF system definition (auto-generated)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 init.lisp            # Initialization file for loading the project\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 source/              # Source code directory\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.lisp     # Package definition\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 file-ordering.isc # Controls file loading order",

    "text": "# Gendl-Skel Project Generator Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nGendl-Skel is a utility for generating skeleton project structures for Gendl applications. It creates a complete directory structure with all necessary files to get your project started.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n```lisp\n;; Load the utility\n(ql:quickload :gendl-skel)\n\n;; Create a new project\n(gendl-skel:gendl-skel :project-name \"my-awesome-project\" :base-path \"/projects/xfer/\")\n```\n\n## Generated Structure\n\nThe utility creates the following structure:\n\n```\nmy-awesome-project/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 my-awesome-project.asd  # Auto-generated ASDF file\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 init.lisp               # Project initialization file\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 source/                 # Source code directory\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.lisp        # Package definition\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 file-ordering.isc   # File loading order configuration\n      \u2514\u2500\u2500 assembly.lisp       # Main assembly object definition\n```\n\n## Generated Files\n\n### init.lisp\n\nThe initialization file contains all necessary code to load your project:",

Update the file-ordering.isc if you add new source files\n4. Modify the default assembly object to suit your needs\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use as Starting Point**: The generated project is a starting point; customize it to fit your needs.\n2. **Keep Object Definitions Modular**: Add new files for complex components.\n3. **Update file-ordering.isc**: Remember to update this when adding new files.\n4. **Leverage Default Documentation**: The generated files include documentation templates; fill them with detailed descriptions.\n5. **Test Incrementally**: Load and test your project after each significant change.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n- Check that your project name is a valid Lisp symbol\n- Ensure you have write permissions for the target directory",
