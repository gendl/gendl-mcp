and loading any lisp files found in source/ subdirectories. A lisp
source file will only be compiled if it is newer than the
corresponding compiled fasl binary file, or if the corresponding
compiled fasl binary file does not exist. A bin/source/ will be
created, as a sibling to each source/ subdirectory, to contain the
compiled fasl files.
If the :create-fasl? keyword argument is specified as non-nil, a
concatenated fasl file, named after the last directory component of
pathname, will be created in the (glisp:temporary-directory).
[Note: this new documentation still needs proper formatting]
If the :create-asd-file? keyword argument is specified as non-nil,
a .asd file suitable for use with ASDF will be emitted into the
directory indicated by the pathname argument. Note that
</p><dl><dt><i>asdf:</i></dt><dd>(Another System Definition Utility), possibly with help of 
Quicklisp, is (as of 2013-03-12) the recommended way for handling
Common Lisp system modules. As of version 2.31.9, ASDF is also
capable of generating fasl "bundle" files as with
the :create-fasl? argument to cl-lite.
For the :author, :version, and :license arguments in the generated
.asd file, the files author.isc, version.isc, and license.isc,
respectively, are consulted, if they exist. They are searched for
first in the codebase toplevel directory (the pathname argument to
this function), then in the (user-homedir-pathname). The version
defaults to the current ISO-8601 date without dashes,
e.g. "20130312".
Please see the Genworks Documentation for an overview of Quicklisp
and ASDF, and see the Quicklisp and ASDF project documentation for
detailed information. The source code for Quicklisp and ASDF should
also be included with your Gendl distribution, and these are
typically loaded by default into the development environment.
For additional inputs to the cl-lite function, please see
codebase-directory-node object for additional inputs (which can be
given as keyword args to this function).
