This is technique for updating one or more sections of a web page based on a request sent to the web server.</p><p>Early web applications were limited to transmitting information to and from the sever using 
synchronous requests, one page at a time. It means your user would fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new 
information from the server. With AJAX, when you click a button, change a value, or do certain other interactions with a page,
the JavaScript engine running in your browser will make a request to the server, which interprets the results and sends a response,
then the JavaScript engine will update the user's web page accordingly. The user would not be directly made aware 
that anything was transmitted to and from the server.</p><h3>Using AJAX with GendL</h3><p>The most basic requirement is to use <span class="mixin">base-html-page</span> as your web pages mixin. This provides most 
of the functionality, and was covered in the first topic of this tutorial, <a href="/websites/simple-html-page/index.html">Creating and Publishing web pages</a></p><p>Next, to trigger an AJAX submit, form controls need to have their input <span class="general-keyword">:ajax-submit-on-change?</span> set to T. This was covered 
in the tutorial topic <a href="/websites/using-form-controls/index.html">Gathering inputs using form-controls</a></p><p>And finally, the page is best constructed from <span class="object">base-html-divs</span>, as shown in the topic <a href="/websites/using-base-html-divs/index.html">Building pages from base-html-divs</a></p><h3>Performance Considerations</h3><p>The javascript update is performed by GendL at the <span class="object">base-html-div</span> level; GendL identifies which <span class="object">base-html-divs</span> will be impacted by the change to the 
form control(s), recomputes the value of the <span class="object">base-html-divs</span> <span class="slot">div</span> and updates the page with that content. So for best 
performance there is a balance to be struck between having sufficient <span class="object">base-html-divs</span> so that large sections of the page which 
don't change are updated and sent from the server to the browser, and having the page defined with so much 
granularity that a large number of (smaller) inserts/updates have to be made</p><p>In the main, however, any optimisation can be performed at the end of the 
development cycle although it is worth bearing in mind the simplicity/granularity tradeoff when building 
the page in the first place. This was also discussed in the topic <a href="/websites/using-base-html-divs/index.html">Building pages from base-html-divs</a></p><p>Using AJAX with GendL is really this simple!</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
