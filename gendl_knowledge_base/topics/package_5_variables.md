Documentation for *GS-GRAPHICS-ALPHA-BITS* <-Back Parameter: *Gs-Graphics-Alpha-Bits* *GS-GRAPHICS-ALPHA-BITS* integer The amount of anti-aliasing for Ghostscript to apply to graphics when making PNG or JPEG images. Defaults to 4. Set to 0 for no antialiasing. <-Back Copyright © 2025 Genworks ® International . All rights reserved. Genworks Build: 1598p001

Documentation for *HASH-TRANSFORMS?* <-Back Parameter: *Hash-Transforms?* *HASH-TRANSFORMS?* boolean Controls whether the transformations of points from three-dimensional world coordinates to two-dimensional display coordinates are cached in memory. Set this to NIL to save memory at the expense of some execution speed. Note: in the current GDL release, transform caching is temporarily disabled, so this parameter will have no effect. Defaults to T. <-Back Copyright © 2025 Genworks ® International . All rights reserved. Genworks Build: 1598p001

Documentation for GEOM-BASE::*ZERO-VECTOR-CHECKING?* <-Back Parameter: Geom-Base::*Zero-Vector-Checking?* *ZERO-VECTOR-CHECKING?* boolean Indicates whether GDL should perform checks for zero-length vectors where nonzero-length vectors are expected. Defaults to T. Setting to NIL will increase execution speed marginally, at the cost of decreased safety. Modify the value of this parameter at your own risk. <-Back Copyright © 2025 Genworks ® International . All rights reserved. Genworks Build: 1598p001
